## **How It Works**

### **BMI Calculation**

The BMI is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight (kg)}}{\text{height (m)}^2}
\]

- Height is converted from centimeters to meters.
- The result is rounded to 2 decimal places.

### **BMI Categories**

- **Underweight**: BMI < 18.5
- **Normal**: 18.5 â‰¤ BMI â‰¤ 24.9
- **Overweight**: 25 â‰¤ BMI â‰¤ 29.9
- **Obese**: BMI â‰¥ 30

### **Advice**

Personalized advice is provided based on the BMI category to help users maintain or achieve a healthy weight.
